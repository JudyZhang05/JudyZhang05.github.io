            <p>
                Precisely is a data-empowered communication service platform that enriches a 
                large quantity of information with context and security, ensuring trusted and 
                accurate data to all users. One of the primary tasks I was assigned during my 
                internship was to develop and refine the style guide for cross-platform modal 
                consistency.

            <div class="quotes">
            <p>
                <b>Problem Statement:</b>
                Style and copy consistency help build trust with our users. We’ve noticed a bit 
                of inconsistency and want to verify alignment of the message copy with the 
                establishment of our Tone of Voice.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Client Challenges:</b>
                Distrust in product reliability, confusion, and loss in efficiency when unreliable
                 modals cause friction for users completing their task.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Client Benefits:</b>
                Adhering to standards enables users to know what to expect, increase learnability, 
                reduce confusion, and increase trust in our product.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Objective:</b>
                Building trust with users by increasing product consistency.

            <span class="subhead"><p>Key Takeaways</p></span>
            <p>
                <b>1. Areas of focus</b> around the patterns of inconsistent modals are found primarily in position aligment, button states, case usage & punctuation, and input area width sizes.
                <br/><b>2. Competitive analysis results</b> share that most modals handle the state of overflowing content as extending the modal vertically, NOT horizontally.
                <br/><b>3. Analysis uncovers modal compoenents</b> to differ, especially with case usage and alignment of call-to-action buttons.

        <div class="desc">
            <p>After touching base with my manager to align all the modal style consistency considerations, I was ready to hand off 
                to the engineers. I had prepared several detailed documents of modal style guidelines and usage for all current and 
                future modals.</p>

            <p>I also delved into Figma and delivered over 40 pixel-perfect revisions and laid a strong foundation 
                for other modals that were deemed out of scope and offered solutions to specific edge cases that future modals could
                 potentially encounter.  By the time of my departure, some of the revisions I had handed off to the engineers had 
                 already been implemented, and many others were in progress.</p>

        <div class="label">Takeaways</div>
        <div class="desc">
            <p>
                The three months I had the privilege of learning at Precisely and collaborating with their talented UX team was the 
                most productive summer I had ever spent. With the encouragement and support of my team, I was able to learn a lot 
                of professionalism simply through watching how others presented their cases and collaborated with engineers and 
                product managers.
                <br/> 
                <br/> 
                Some of the biggest takeaways I learned were how important and useful <b>proper and intentional documentation</b> of 
                one’s work can be. Not only does it help organize your project, but it also cuts down on the time spent explaining 
                everything you’ve done to other collaborators who will inevitably be added to the project. 
                <br/> 
                <br/> 
                Another takeaway I 
                learned was how crucially essential it is to be on top of your project scope. Being excited is all good and all, 
                but it is even better to <b>set appropriate goals and milestones</b>, especially if it is as easy for you as it was for 
                me to get blindsighted into researching and ideating solutions that were not part of my original task. However, 
                I was able to turn this around by gaining and exercising another crucial skill to have, <b>allowing flexibility while 
                remaining adapatibile</b> in a time-constrained situation. 
                <br/> 
                <br/> 
                Lastly, communication, there really is a difference in how much 
                of an impact one’s public speaking and ability to <b>convey their design decisions to others</b> plays in getting through 
                to the shareholders why a design decision is worth implementing. I strive to grow and refine these skills as I 
                continue taking on new and exciting challenges in my future work.
