        ,problem: "In today's day and age, air pollution like the greenhouse gases has been at it's highest ever in history. At this rate, our state of living will become exponentially unsustainable and unstable. Now more than ever, every bit of contribution from us, earth's inhabitant, counts! One way to tackle this issue is by growing more greeneries, but getting started might be difficult and even intimdating."
        ,solution: "What is the solution for starting anything intimating? Doing it with friends in a welcoming community! It is never too late to start your planting journey and what better way to share this passion with others than with a dedicated platform filled with planter enthusiast and veterans. Complete with it's very own digital plant, you can reenact even the feeling of growing your own plant sharing foundation in a digital environment called PlaneTree by interacting and engaging with other peoples plant entries and journies!"
        ,design: "For the design process, the most difficult part was coming up with the concpet. For that I had composited together an inspiration board filled with bright and lively themes of food, entries, and artistry. Once I perfected the idea enough, I moved on to lo-fi wireframing. Making sure to focus on quantity and not quality to produce as many layouts and compositions as possible to figure out the best possible approach that will fit the intended purpose while enhancing the user experience. The first couple iterations went smoothly and I swiftly moved onto high fidelity mockups. At this point I had been working non-stop and when I took a step back it became clear, half-way through, I had lost the vision. Thus I started over. Redesigned the plain ordered grid layouut to a more artistic approach that encouraged users engagement. From there I seamlessly moved on to considering color-pallete, font choices, and even some custom visuals to accompany the artistic layout. You can view the figma page <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/design/bbmSmSHDFp9uXzHssmW2Ey/MEDP331?node-id=184-2&p=f&t=r0OCbradZW4RA90q-0\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"elink\">here</a>."
        ,develop: "For the development process, I had a harder time bringing the layout to life than I imagined I would. After several experimentations with trial and error, I was able to achieve the desire look intuitively. PlaneTree utilizies Glitch as the host, NodeJs Express Server to run the program, MongoDB to store plant and user data, Cloudinary to store and upload photos, and GSAP library for accompanying interaction animations to top it all off.

Reading his horror novels and watching their adapted horror movies are great and all, but like a true horror addict, if you were in these horrific narratives and story retellings, you'd want to know which character you were, but more intriguing, which villain you are.  "
        ,solution: "Well, look no further! Utilizing an open-source Application Programming Interface (API) on Stephen King's Villains and some magic in the Back-End, you can pinpoint exactly which villain you would be portrayed as in the Stephen King universe. The results may surprise, horrify, or intrigue you. Just a click of a button or 2 and this webpage will satisfy your curiosity in the best way possible!"
        ,design: "The design for this is relatively short, sweet, and simple. The background is pure black to set the atmosphere, the font color is red because of blood, and the font style is this childlike marker handwriting but in all caps to convey some sense of false urgency. To interact with the webpage and get the results, all the users would need to input is their first and last names and their year of birth. After submitting their input, it should bring the user to a different page that displays the resulting villain name, and other available details regarding that villain from the API."
        ,develop: "The development is where all the magic happens. The Stephen King Villain website utilizes node.js, express, body-parser (as the middleware), Axios, and embedded javascript to function. Through its client-server architectural programming allows the user to receive a computed response from the fetched RESTful Stephen King API found <a href=\"https://stephen-king-api.onrender.com\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"elink\">here</a>. The express server then uses event handlers to retrieve data from the API and computes and filters them through a specific set of conditional statements to display a particular villain to the user. To display the computed data, this webpage utilizes embedded javascript to translate the information onto the webpage, showing a different result if the output comes out empty.

I wanted to fully convey my vision of the scenes to the audience without having the imagery too distracting to focus on the dialogue, thus I designed everything else rather simple and in a stark white color to contrast against the black background and elaborate paintings. The rounded borders of the story options and window screen illude to a more playful style. The dialogue is typed out letter by letter at a slow pace to give the audience time to read and analyze the evolving plot. I made sure to have the dialogue play one at a time from top to bottom to prevent confusion between them and the context."

This website is aimed to assist people who tend to bottle up their emotions in an unhealthy manner or those who simply don't have anyone to confide in but would like others to hear. Additionally, there would be an option for those who would like to seek professional help.  "
        ,problem: "The act of keeping a secret has been well studied and research shows that they have a direct negative impact on one's mental, emotional, physical, and spiritual health. Burdening yourself with a secret, especially negative ones, has proven to cause anxiety and distress from an increase in stress hormones. Additionally, there could be circumstances that may prohibit someone's physical access to professional help.  "
        ,solution: "Feel ReLeaf, offers a free alternative to help those who are seeking to confide in a larger community or professional aid remotely. No one deserves to suffer in solitude and isolation, and sometimes simply talking about it could help significantly. Even possibly clearing their headspace and relieving them of a much too heavy burden that was placed on them inadvertently. Mental health is a critical underlying issue that does not constrain itself to one state or one culture. This happens worldwide and for that reason, I knew I had to incorporate a translation option, to reach a global audience. Feel ReLeaf is a website that focuses on becoming a reliable and supportive place for those who need it."
        ,design: "For this design, I needed to recreate a space that resembled somewhere one would feel liberated. Free of all their ongoing burdens and struggles. For a moment, I wanted the user to be in a headspace where they wouldn't feel obligated to talk or take action, but more like they were accepting a warm embrace of acceptance, understanding, and being generously welcomed. Thus, I picked out some open fields peaceful nature scenes, surrounded by flowers and clear open skies. The duo nature theme worked perfectly to achieve the sentiment that I was going for on both the write and read secret pages. Along with the bright pastels and fancy script-like font provides the professional edge that I wanted to maintain. <br/><br/> *Note: This was my graduating project that I presented for a summer course with Code First Girls. Check out my presentation below!"
        ,develop: "Ultizing the integrated programming environment called \"Codepen\", I developed a website that is separated into two sections. A write a secret section and a read a secret section. You would not be able to access the read a secret without inputting a secret of your own. There are some placeholder secrets in the read-a-secret section collected by anonymous people online. Additionally, I implemented a leave another button so you could write another secret and read another button so that you can shuffle through the secrets, perhaps even finding yours in the mix. The translation option stays between the write and read secret pages, while the background images and color pallet slowly transition from a pastel green to a lilac purple. The website is complete with some smooth animations in the beginning to welcome the users and the transition between the two separate sections. I purposefully animated the transition to seem like flipping a page over to invoke an emotion as if they've turned a new page or started a new chapter having relieved themselves of this secret. <br/><br/> *Note: The translations are no longer functional."

Some of these liberties that I created were the comical advertisement displayed on the right sidebar and the hearted follow element on the top right of each post. The placeholder content and reactions I supplied to the clone reflect the lively and uplifting community that LinkedIn has produced over the years.

In the Firebase Database team, I focused on collecting and keeping track of user's interaction with the webpage and adding them to a Firebase database.
